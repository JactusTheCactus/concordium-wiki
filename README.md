# __The Concordium__

__The Concordium__ was a group of 14 _Holy Knights_, directly serving the King. 7 of these Holy Knights betrayed the others, framing them for _high treason against the kingdom_, and sentencing them for a millenium. with this sentencing, the betrayed Holy Knights, now called __The Seven Deadly Sins__, were further punished with __The Capital Curses__, from the remnants of _The Old Gods_. The other half of __The Concordium__ called themselves __The Seven Heavenly Virtues__, and continued selling their false tale of the Sins' betrayal.
