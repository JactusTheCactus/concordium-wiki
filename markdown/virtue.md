# __The Concordium__
__The Concordium__ was a group of 14 _Holy Knights_, directly serving the King. 7 of these Holy Knights betrayed the others, framing them for _high treason against the kingdom_, and sentencing them for a millenium. with this sentencing, the betrayed Holy Knights, now called __The Seven Deadly Sins__, were further punished with __The Capital Curses__, from _The Blood of The Dead Gods_.
